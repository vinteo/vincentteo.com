# Backends — the dual image engine

illo renders through one of two backends. Both produce the same kind of
file; they differ only in where the image is made and who is billed.

- **Codex** — drives the user's already-installed, already-logged-in **Codex
  CLI** (`codex exec`) to reach its built-in `image_generation` tool
  (gpt-image-2). Free for Codex subscribers (no per-image charge); it draws
  on the user's Codex usage quota.
- **OpenRouter** — calls OpenRouter's image API directly. Pay-per-image
  through the user's OpenRouter account. The **universal fallback** and the
  only backend a host without Codex can use.

`--backend` (and config `backend:`) selects one explicitly; otherwise the
engine resolves the right one by host capability. Resolution and readiness
are reported by `doctor`.

## Resolution and default (capability-aware)

The backend is resolved per run, never a static flip:

```
--backend  >  config backend:  >  capability-aware default
```

The **capability-aware default** is, in order:

1. a **usable Codex CLI** is present → `codex`;
2. else an **OpenRouter key** is configured → `openrouter`;
3. else neither → onboarding (the engine names both fixes).

This never silently breaks an existing OpenRouter-only install on upgrade: a
host with a key but no Codex CLI still resolves to `openrouter`, so `doctor`
stays exit 0. An explicit `--backend`/`backend:` choice is honored as-is;
readiness is judged separately, so `doctor` can flag a
chosen-but-unusable backend.

### Migration: existing configs choose once

The config carries a `configVersion` stamp (current: `2`, the version that
introduced the backend choice). A config written by an **older install** lacks
it — that user has never been offered Codex vs OpenRouter, and silently picking
either one (flipping them to Codex, or quietly keeping OpenRouter so they never
learn Codex exists) is the wrong call. So an out-of-date config is **not
auto-resolved**:

- `generate` **hard-stops** with a message to choose a backend (an agent reusing
  an old playbook learns its config is stale rather than rendering on a guess).
- `doctor` reports `backend: NEEDS CHOICE` and exits non-zero.

The choice is surfaced **interactively** (the agent asks Codex vs OpenRouter; see
SKILL.md "Config migration") and persisted with
`init --backend <codex|openrouter> --no-key`, which stamps `configVersion` and
keeps any existing key. A brand-new install (no config) is ordinary onboarding,
not a migration — it resolves capability-aware as above. The stamp, not the
`backend` key's absence, is the signal: a current-version user who chose "auto"
also has no `backend` key but is not re-prompted.

## Codex backend

### The Codex-CLI requirement (detection)

Eligibility is a property of the **execution host**, detected — never
assumed. A Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini, Hermes, or OpenClaw run on a
CLI-equipped host all qualify equally; a Codex-harness run on a bare host
does not. The host is "usable Codex" only when **all three** hold:

1. `codex` is on `PATH`;
2. `codex login status` reports logged in;
3. `codex features list` reports both `image_generation` and `imagegenext`
   rows are present. `imagegenext` may be default-disabled; illo enables it per
   render with `--enable imagegenext`, so presence is the capability signal.

Any non-zero exit, timeout, or unparseable output → not usable, and the
engine soft-falls to OpenRouter. Detection runs once per process and reads
**no** credential file and **no** secret-shaped env var. `doctor` reports
the stage that failed (`codex login` needed, feature unavailable, etc.).

If the user needs to enable it: install the official Codex CLI and run
`codex login` — that is the entire setup. illo never touches the token.

### gpt-image-2 is automatic — no model selection

The free built-in tool exposes **no model selector**; it renders with
Codex's current default, **gpt-image-2**. So on the Codex backend the
`--model` flag and config `model:` **do not apply** — they are an
OpenRouter-only axis. (Pinning a model would require the *billed*
`image_gen.py --model` CLI, which needs an API key and defeats "free for
subscribers" — out of scope.)

Aspect has no size argument on the free tool either; illo states the aspect
in the prompt text, which gpt-image-2 honors. As always, check
`.width/.height` in the JSON line and re-roll a stray wrong-dimension result.

### Quota, not a per-image charge

"Free" means there is no per-image dollar charge — it **draws on the user's
Codex usage quota**, and image turns consume that allowance faster than text
turns. The questionnaire (run by the user during `init`) states this before
enabling Codex.

### Transport and character lock

illo invokes `codex exec` against the built-in tool, attaching the active
character's reference sheet (`-i <sheet>`) so the mascot stays on-model, and
asks the agent to save the result to the run-dir path. As of Codex CLI 0.141,
the stable `image_generation` feature being available is not enough for `exec`
to expose generated image artifacts reliably; illo also passes
`--enable imagegenext`. Without that flag the text agent may see the reference
image and claim it generated an image, while no `$CODEX_HOME/generated_images`
artifact appears; the agent can then satisfy the requested path with local
drawing/code, which is not a valid illo render. Keep this flag until Codex
makes the imagegen extension default or replaces it with a stable equivalent.
If `imagegenext` hits the known `image_gen` namespace-collision failure
(openai/codex#28464), illo treats the Codex backend as unavailable and falls
back to OpenRouter when configured.

With no `--ref` and no
default character there is nothing to lock to, so illo renders ref-less (a
one-line note marks it) — matching OpenRouter, and exactly what bootstrapping a
brand-new character's first model sheet needs (`references/character-builder.md`
step 4). illo handles **no token**: it runs no OAuth, reads no
`~/.codex/auth.json`, hits no endpoint —
the only privileged action is the subprocess call to the user's own CLI
(the one sanctioned exception to the stdlib-over-subprocess rule — a benign
call to a known CLI, not a credential read). The adapter verifies the file
landed, otherwise fetches the
freshest image the tool dropped under `$CODEX_HOME/generated_images/`
(`$CODEX_HOME` resolved at run time — relocatable, never hardcoded).

### Windows/WSL is unsupported → OpenRouter

`codex exec` image generation is broken on Windows/WSL (openai/codex#19133).
illo treats that as a backend failure and falls over to OpenRouter when a key
is configured.

### Fallback behavior

When the Codex backend is unavailable or fails for **any** non-fatal reason —
no usable CLI, `codex exec` errored or timed out, unsupported platform, or no
retrievable image — illo:

- falls back to **OpenRouter** when a key is configured (the manifest record
  is tagged `backend: openrouter`); or
- exits with a clear, actionable error naming both fixes (install +
  `codex login`, or run `init` to set an OpenRouter key) when no key is set.

A Codex-served record carries `cost: null` and no model id, and the engine
never queries OpenRouter for its cost.

## OpenRouter backend

The pay-per-image path, billed to the user's OpenRouter account. It is
**model-selectable** (`--model`; see `references/models.md` for the lineup,
the friendly-name → id map, the aspect caveat, and 404/fallback handling) and
is the universal fallback for any host where Codex is unavailable. Its wire
behavior is unchanged from a single-backend install — the dual-backend work
is purely additive.
